# Open Repositories 2021 Developers Track: Two features, 10 lines of code.

The code in this repository was used for an [Open Repositories 2021](https://or2021.openrepositories.org/) Developers Track submission. This is intended to provide an example of how simple additional functionality is to add to the Haplo Repository due to the well-designed plugin APIs.

## Features:

* UI element to inform users of an item's quality using a simple metric.

* Example metadata schema added to the OAI-PMH interface which exposes items' title, type, and quality (using a simple metric).
